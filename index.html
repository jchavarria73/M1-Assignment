  <script>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hi, everyone. My name is Jose Chavarria. I am trying to major in Digital Media. My immediate goal is to get my Associates Degree in Digital Media. After this semester, I have one class left. After I graduate, I will be pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Media. After that, I will be looking for work as a graphic designer. I hope to specialize in drawing illustrations. Once I establish myself, I hope to get married, have a couple of kids, and grow old. The best thing that happened to me over break was going to the movies with my family. I especially enjoyed watching the release of the Super Mario Bros. Movie.";</script>
